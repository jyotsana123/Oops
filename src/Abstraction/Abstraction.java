//Normal method contains methods declaration and implementation
//Abstract method contains method declaration only we implement letter, And we declare that method as abstract keyword
//the class contains at least one abstract method the class called abstract class.
//to declare abstract class is a abstract class we declare class as abstract modifier
//Abstract class may contain abstract method may not contain abstract method but object creation is not possible for abstract classes
//If the abstract class has abstract method, write the implementation in child class
//The abstract class hold child class object
//Child class has to complete the implementation, If unable to complete the implementation then it must be abstract class
//You can take any no. of child class but you need to make a complete implementation
//Abstract method can have any return type & any no. of arguments.
//Abstract method can have method implementation or not method implementation, You can declare class as abstract, that class called abstract class, you can not create object of abstract class.
//you can not write - Final Abstract, Private Abstract, Static Abstract
//main method is possible in abstract class
//constructor is possible in abstract class
